## GenOptics

**Duration**: 2020-2023

Main aims:
- [GenOptics](https://genoptics.github.io/) will implement a new platform for integrating, analyzing and visualizing multi-omics and other clinico-biological data, by extending the functionality of established bioinformatic analysis tools through an interactive visual dashboard.
- [GenOptics](https://genoptics.github.io/) will allow visual analytics of multi-omics data through a modular system that will integrate multiple interoperable analysis tools into a software platform, leveraging established international technologies and software suites such as Docker and R/Bioconductor.
