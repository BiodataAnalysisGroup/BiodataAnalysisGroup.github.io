<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/arena_logo.png" alt="ARENA logo" style="width:200px;"/>


*AI Research Enhancement through Networked Agents*

- **Duration**: 2026-2029
- **Funder**: HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-EOSC-05
- **Description**: EOSC-ARENA goes beyond the simple application of GenAI solutions to specific cases, focusing on delivering an ambitious agentic AI system, enhancing researchers with tools that are not only advanced in terms of GenAI but also adaptive and responsive to the dynamic needs of scientific inquiry (via agents). Our vision extends beyond traditional GenAI applications by working on three different foundation areas: (i) A sophisticated GenAI agentic system, with a strong focus on scientific robustness; (ii) a community building and sound training program focused on responsible usage, enabling researchers to perform informed decisions, aligned with EU values from an ethical and human-centric perspective; and (iii) a comprehensive set of GenAI infrastructure services. All together, these three areas serve as enablers in order to deliver the final sovereign AI ecosystem to enable open science and collaborative Human-AI work.

##  CANDLE

<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/candle_logo.png" alt="CANDLE logo" style="width:200px;"/>


[*National CAncer data Node DeveLopErs*](https://candle-project.eu/)

- **Duration**: 2025-2028
- **Funder**: HORIZON-MISS-2024-CANCER-01
- **Description**: Coordinated by Health-RI and with a consortium of 40 partners from 20 European countries, the project will support Member States and Associated Countries in setting up National Cancer Data Nodes. These Nodes will promote the development of standardized services for managing and sharing cancer data nationally and across borders, connecting different national actors.
Despite vast amounts of cancer-related data in Europe, fragmentation and lack of interoperability hinder progress in cancer research and treatment. CANDLE addresses this by establishing trusted nodes to connect data, tools, and expertise across borders. These National Cancer Data Nodes will facilitate access to cancer data from across Europe. Cancer researchers can then access more data than is currently accessible – and help Europe better understand cancer. This can fuel the development of new cancer treatments, diagnostics, and better information to patients, survivors, and carers – and much more.
CANDLE will work toward this by:
  - Promoting the development and implementation of National Cancer Data Nodes in participating countries, to support users in handling their data with the right applications and underlying infrastructure.
  - Promoting harmonisation and standardisation of cancer data.
  - Supporting data discoverability, accessibility, and reuse in line with FAIR principles.
  - Enabling cross-border, GDPR-compliant data sharing for research and innovation.
  - Benefiting from the European Health Data Space and contributing to the UNCAN.eu European Cancer Data Infrastructure.

[*Understanding and addressing LATE-effects of treatment of AYA cancer survivors with AI-based digital phenotyping and non-invasive holistic approach*](https://www.late-aya.eu/)

- **Duration**: 2025-2030
- **Funder**: HORIZON-MISS-2024-CANCER-01-05
- **Description**: Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) face a distinct set of challenges, including increased risks of secondary cancers, cardiovascular diseases, infertility, and mental health issueslike anxiety and depression. Oncology programs delivering care to AYAs provide survivors with individualised survivorship care plans at the end of treatment, to accompany follow-up with their primary care providers. However, adherence to these plans is often scarce, due to differences in AYA survivors’ age, sex, cancer treatment received, and socioeconomical conditions. Knowledge and understanding of such factors and of related late effects and impacts on quality of life is fundamental to providing effective survivorship care. The ubiquitous use of mobile devices by AYAs offers an opportunity to increase knowledge and understanding of AYAs cancer survivors’ health status and behaviours, allowing the modelling of late effects and quality of life trajectories in the different age subgroups. Digital health interventions overcome many barriers to AYA participation in survivorship programs. LATE-AYA seeks to fill this gap by empowering AYAs to better manage their health and well-being post-cancer, by developing an AI-driven digital phenotyping platform for managing late effects (LE) of cancer treatment. The project will implement a holistic, non-invasive approach through digital tools such as smartphones and wearables to monitor physical, psychological, and social well-being. The project will focus on preventive health behaviours, psychological support, and social reintegration, providing personalized care through digital interventions. LATE-AYA will contribute to long-term quality of life improvements, facilitate early detection of LE, and provide data-driven insights on the impact of lifestyle choices on health outcomes. This project is supported by a diverse consortium of European institutions and will leverage the UNCAN.eu platform to share data and models, fostering wider collaboration across the EU. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on “Quality of life (AYA)”.

- **Duration**: 2024-2029
- **Funder**: HORIZON-JU-IHI-2023-05-04
- **Description**: SYNTHIA is an ambitious collaboration between public and private institutions to facilitate the responsible use of Synthetic Data (SD) in healthcare applications. The project will improve the methodological and technical aspects of SD Generation (SDG) by developing new techniques and advancing established ones for different data modalities, including genomics and imaging, to improve the generation of realistic multimodal and longitudinal data. This project will provide the research community with approaches for transparent benchmarking of alternative SDG methods for specific applications, identify and establish evaluation metrics and methodologies, and contribute to the standardisation of an evaluation assessment framework for SD. Robust evidence of SD applicability in a set of use cases across a broad spectrum of medical conditions will be crucial to demonstrate the potential of SD to accelerate data-driven solutions of equivalent quality to those derived from real patient data. Furthermore, legal and regulatory implications of SD use will be analysed with the aim of delivering an assurance framework to guide secure SD utilization in healthcare. These significant breakthroughs will be implemented through the open SYNTHIA federated platform, facilitating responsible SD use by the health research community. The platform will facilitate users´ long-term access to extensively validated, reusable synthetic datasets, as well as to SDG workflows and SD assessment frameworks. The federated infrastructure will rely on extended open-source frameworks for interoperability with other data-sharing infrastructures in the context of the European Health Data Space. A multidisciplinary collaboration of SDG developers, FAIR data experts, clinical researchers, developers of therapies and data-based tools, legal experts, socio-economic analysts, regulatory, policy advocacy, and communication experts will provide a 360º vision on how to advance healthcare applications through SD use.

## AHEAD

<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/AHEADLogo.png" alt="AHEAD logo" style="width:150px;"/>


[*AI for Health: Evaluation of Applications & Datasets*](https://ahead-msca.eu/)

- **Duration**: 2025-2028
- **Funder**: HORIZON-MSCA-2023-SE-01
- **Description**: The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on the rise, and yet, there remains a lack of consensus on standardised approaches for responsible implementation. In Europe, there is a strong push to regulate AI, particularly in high-impact societal applications such as biomedicine and healthcare. The objective of AHEAD is to create a transdisciplinary, diverse and global community drawing on the expertise of professionals in biomedicine, ethics, AI development, software engineering, sociology, psychology, law, gender studies, and relevant stakeholders, dedicated to the ongoing effort of tackling challenges and setting important standards in an ever-changing landscape. Together, the community will gather, consolidate, and put into practice established principles and guidelines, building a methodology and a platform to evaluate AI-based systems for biomedical and healthcare applications to ensure the compliance with legal, ethical, technical, scientific, and regulatory standards. The project will extend the fucntionalities of OpenEBench, ELIXIR’s benchmarking platform for bioinformatics tools, to provide a platform for these assessments. The community will also establish an observatory to collect and curate existing guidelines, best practices, and principles for AI assessment in biomedicine and healthcare across multiple disciplines (technical, societal, legal, etc.). AHEAD will  encourage responsible AI innovation through constant collaboration and knowledge exchanges, to continuously meet the demands of the fast-changing AI landscape and ensure that quality healthcare for all people is never compromised and only enhanced. The proposed project is the beginning of a sustained endeavour that would greatly benefit from mobility grants to enhance community bonds and foster collaborative efforts toward this goal.

##  SciLake

<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/scilake.png" alt="SciLake" style="width:120px;"/>

[*Democratising and making sense out of heterogeneous scholarly content*](https://scilake.eu/)

- **Duration**: 2023 – 2026
- **Funder**:  HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-04
- **Description**: SciLake’s mission is to build upon the OpenAIRE ecosystem and EOSC services to (a) facilitate and empower the creation, interlinking and maintenance of SKGs and the execution of data science and graph mining queries on top of them, (b) contribute to the democratization of scholarly content and the related added value services implementing a community-driven management approach, and (c) offer advanced, AI-assisted services that exploit customised perspectives of scientific merit to assist the navigation of the vast scientific knowledge space. In brief, SciLake will develop, support, and offer customisable services to the research community following a two-tier service architecture. First, it will offer a comprehensive, open, transparent, and customisable scientific data-lake-as-a-service (service tier 1), empowering and facilitating the creation, interlinking, and maintenance of SKGs both across and within different scientific disciplines. On top of that, it will build and offer a tier of customisable, AI-assisted services that facilitate the navigation of scholarly content following a scientific merit-driven approach (tier 2), focusing on two merit aspects which are crucial for the research community at large: impact and reproducibility. The services in both tiers will leverage advanced AI techniques (text and graph mining) that are going to exploit and extend existing technologies provided by SciLake’s technology partners. Finally, to showcase the value of the provided services and their capability to address current and anticipated needs of different research communities, four scientific domains (neuroscience, cancer research, transportation, and energy) have been selected to serve as pilots. For each, the developed services will be customised, to accommodate differences in research procedures, practices, impact measures and types of research objects, and will be validated and evaluated through real-world use cases.

[*CA21160 - Non-globular proteins in the era of Machine Learning*](https://www.cost.eu/cost-action/non-globular-proteins-in-the-era-of-machine-learning/)

- **Duration**: 2022 - 2026
- **Funder**: [Cost - European Cooperation in Science & Technology](https://www.cost.eu/)
- **Description**: Protein structure prediction has long been considered the “Holy Grail” of structural biology. The recent success of AlphaFold has ushered in a new era of highly accurate structure prediction, bringing to light the secrets hidden in the three-dimensional structures of globular proteins, increasing our understanding about their structural features and molecular function. However, a large proportion of the proteomes from all domains of life are rich in sequences that do not fold into regular structures, commonly known as non-globular proteins (NGPs). NGPs comprise intrinsically disordered regions, repeats, low-complexity sequences, aggregation-prone and phase-separating sequences, and are implicated in a range of age-related diseases. Their heterogeneous structural states and low sequence complexity challenge current experimental structure determination techniques and machine learning (ML) methods for structure prediction, making the molecular understanding of their sequence-structure-dynamics-function relationship difficult. The recent improvements of ML approaches and advances in determining NGP structural ensembles call for a timely re-assessment of the interplay between experiments and computation. The ML4NGP Action aims to establish an interdisciplinary pan-European network to favour this interplay, fostering experimental frameworks designed to provide information to computational methods, and novel computational methods developed, trained and benchmarked with experimental data. ML4NGP will enhance the primary experimental data generation (WG1), promote integrative structural biology approaches (WG2), benchmark the state-of-the-art ML methods (WG3) and improve the functional characterization of NGPs (WG4). The Action will support its scientific objectives through policies that sustain free knowledge exchange, inclusiveness and training of young researchers who will lead future innovations in this field.

<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/EOSC4Cancer.png" alt="EOSC4Cancer" style="width:200px;"/>

[*A European-wide foundation to accelerate Data-driven Cancer Research*](https://eosc4cancer.eu/)

- **Duration**: 2023-2026
- **Funder**: HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-06
- **Description**: Cancer complex nature requires integration of advanced research data across national boundaries to enable progress. Indeed, the Horizon Europe mission board for cancer has identified access to data, knowledge and digital services - accessible across the European Research Area through federated infrastructures - as a key enabling condition for success. The better we organise cancer data across Europe, the better and faster we can bring the fruits of new biological and technical innovations to the benefit of EU citizens/patients. EOSC4Cancer will make cancer genomics, imaging, medical, clinical, environmental and socio-economics data accessible, using and enhancing existing federated and interoperable systems for securely identifying, sharing, processing and reusing FAIR cancer data across borders, and it will offer them via community-driven analysis environments. EOSC4Cancer provision of well curated datasets will be essential for advanced analytics and computational methods to be reproducible and robust, including machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. EOSC4Cancer use-cases will cover the patient journey from cancer prevention to diagnosis to treatment, laying the foundation of data trajectories and workflows for future cancer mission projects. EOSC4Cancer brings together a comprehensive consortium of cancer research centres, research infrastructures, leading research groups, hospitals and supercomputing centres from 14 European countries. To make the developments sustainable, these will be offered as part of the research infrastructures partners services portfolio, in connection with the EOSC ecosystem and to serve the European Cancer Mission, which will be possible via the engagement with large international coalitions, e.g. ICGC-Argo, GA4GH, 1+MG/B1MG, Cancer Core Europe, European Cancer Information System, European Network of Cancer Registries, Innovative Partnership for Action Against Cancer Joint Action and patients/survivors associations.

<img src="/assets/img/collaborations/GenOptics_logo.png" alt="GenOptics" style="width:150px;"/>

[*Large Scale bio-data Visual analytics platform*](https://genoptics.github.io/)

- **Duration**: 2020 - 2023
- **Funder**: [General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)](http://www.gsrt.gr/)
- **Description**: GenOptics is a 30-month national project (2020-2023) that will implement a new platform for integrating, analyzing and visualizing multi-omics and other clinico-biological data, by extending the functionality of established bioinformatic analysis tools through an interactive visual dashboard. Visual analytics, namely the simultaneous use of computational data analysis tools with interactive visualizations, is a powerful way of combining algorithms with an intuitive, user-friendly interactive environment in order to extract knowledge from large scale bio-data. Although visual analytics could contribute to significantly reducing the gap between available data and discovery of new knowledge through targeted studies, there is no widely used platform that provides this functionality to the scientific community. GenOptics will allow visual analytics of multi-omics data through a modular system that will integrate multiple interoperable analysis tools into a software platform, leveraging established international technologies and software suites such as Docker and R/Bioconductor.
