## GenOptics

[**GenOptics**](https://genoptics.github.io/) (_Large Scale bio-data Visual analytics platform_)
- **Duration**: 2020 - 2023
- **Funder**: [General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)](http://www.gsrt.gr/)
- **Description**: GenOptics is a 30-month national project (2020-2023) that will implement a new platform for integrating, analyzing and visualizing multi-omics and other clinico-biological data, by extending the functionality of established bioinformatic analysis tools through an interactive visual dashboard. Visual analytics, namely the simultaneous use of computational data analysis tools with interactive visualizations, is a powerful way of combining algorithms with an intuitive, user-friendly interactive environment in order to extract knowledge from large scale bio-data. Although visual analytics could contribute to significantly reducing the gap between available data
and discovery of new knowledge through targeted studies, there is no widely used platform that provides this functionality to the scientific community. GenOptics will allow visual analytics of multi-omics data through a modular system that will integrate multiple interoperable analysis tools into a software platform, leveraging established international technologies and software suites such as Docker and R/Bioconductor.

## Gallantries

[**Gallantries**](https://galaxy-carpentries.github.io/gallantries/) (_When Galaxy meets Carpentries to develop and deliver open and scalable training in life sciences_)
- **Duration**: 2020 - 2023
- **Funder**: [Erasmus+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en)
- **Description**: Rapid development of DNA sequencing technologies has made it possible for biomedical disciplines to rival the physical sciences in data production capability. Today’s sequencing instruments rival those fields in terms of data throughput. Yet biology is different from these disciplines in one fundamental aspect—the lack of computational and data analysis training in standard biomedical curricula. Given their cumulative experience and expertise in training for Life Sciences, the next step for these communities is to work together towards a full curriculum on the computational analysis of HTS data, starting from raw data and leading up to the production of publication ready visualizations of the analysis results. More importantly, these training activities should be scalable and accessible to anyone around the globe, particularly for people unable to attend face-to-face workshops due to social, technical or cultural limitations, leveraging new technologies to overcome this obstacle. Gallantries aims to bridge the different training communities (EMBL, The Carpentries, Galaxy, ELIXIR, GOBLET) and fill the remaining gap in bioinformatics training.
