<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
One of the biggest challenges in Life Sciences is the high complexity and volume of the involved bio-data, as well as the lack of appropriate analysis tools that can be employed for the extraction of new knowledge. In the field of bioinformatics, there is an increasing trend towards the development of user-friendly tools for the analysis and interpretation of large-scale bio-data, with a variety of specialized tools and management approaches available in recent literature. However, there are few solutions which are aimed at managing the extensive heterogeneity of the ever increasing bio-data, especially in the field of Medicine and Cancer
Genomics. Goal of GenOptics is to implement a new platform for integrating, analyzing and visualizing multi-omics and other clinicobiogical data, by extending the functionality of established bioinformatic analysis tools through an interactive visual dashboard. Visual analytics, namely the simultaneous use of computational data analysis tools with interactive visualizations, is a powerful way of combining algorithms with an intuitive, user-friendly interactive environment in order to extract knowledge from large scale bio-data. Although visual analytics could contribute to significantly reducing the gap between available data
and discovery of new knowledge through targeted studies, there is no widely used platform that provides this functionality to the scientific community. GenOptics will allow visual analytics of multi-omics data through a modular system that will integrate multiple interoperable analysis tools into a software platform, leveraging established international technologies and software suites such as Docker and R/Bioconductor.</p>

<p>GenOptics will address the following two challenges involving three academic institutions and two companies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective 1</strong>: Integrate computational data analysis processes with a flexible visualization system as a single process through a visual analytics dashboard. GenOptics’ ultimate goal is to conceal from the users the technical complexity generated from the interconnection and integration of heterogeneous and multi-omics biodata as well as the corresponding analysis tools and visualization techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective 2</strong>: A better exploitation of the accumulated volume of multi-omics data allowing the identification of new biomarkers and new therapeutic targets through targeted clinicobiological studies. The GenOptics platform will be evaluated and validated through four pilot cases: (i) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the Western world; (ii) hepatocellular carcinoma, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide; (iii) colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer worldwide, with a growing number of new cases in each year and a strong link with the western lifestyle, and (iv) cystic fibrosis, the 2nd most frequent in disease vectors and the 1st in number of births genetic disease of the Greek population.</li>
</ul>

<p>GenOptics will effectively reduce both the time and the total cost in the traditionally complex analysis processes of clinical research and diagnosis. In addition, through the integration of multi-omics bio-data with clinical information, the project will attempt to provide answers to key questions such as the reliable predictive classification of patients based on the identification of new patterns and the emergence of new prognostic indicators. Finally, a thorough assessment and comprehensive evaluation of the GenOptics platform based on the supported functionality and the final results in the four pilot cases, will open the way for its systematic promotion as a credible and accredited commercial solution.</p>
